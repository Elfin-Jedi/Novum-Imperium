###MINOR TITLES###
title_praefectus_household;Praefectus Domestikos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_household_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Domestikos, or Prefect of the Household, is responsible for the upkeep of the various imperial homes and palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_coaches;Praefectus Equitum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_coaches_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Equitum, or Prefect of Horses, is responsible for ensuring all of the imperial mounts are in good health and of good breeding - both those for recreation, such as hunting, and those for warfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_prisons;Praefectus Iudicium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_prisons_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Iudicium, or Prefect of Justice, is responsible for overseeing any prisoners (and their resultant fates) in the Empire, as well as handling various legal matters that are bought before the administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_guards;Praefectus Custodes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_guards_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Custodes, or "Prefect of the Guard", is the chief of the Emperor's personal bodyguard. Naturally, this is nowhere near as active a role as it was during the days of the Praetorians, and has very little real power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_herald;Praefectus Scriptorum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_herald_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Scriptorum, or Prefect of Writing, is responsible for overseeing all imperial correspondance, both for records and official communication. Being as the paperwork of imperial beauracracy is so vast, they command many more juniour scribes to handle most of the actual writing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_agriculture;Praefectus Agricultura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_agriculture_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Agricultura, or Prefect of Agriculture, oversees not just the intake and dolling of grains, meats and other agricultural products, but is also ensures that the various cultures and peoples of the Empire are using standardised measurements - an important task when the main culture of an Empire is the melting pot of two parent cultures with no common tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_urban;Praefects Urbanus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_urban_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Urbanus, literally meaning Prefect of Cities but more commonly known as the Urban Prefect, is responsible for the security of the major cities of the Empire, most notably the capital. This not only means military security, but also law enforcement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_aquaducts;Praefectus Viae Publicae et Aquarium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_praefectus_aquaducts_desc;One of the 7 Ministerial roles of China, adapted to Roman understanding. The Praefectus Viae Publicae et Aquarium, meaning "The Prefect of Public Roads and Aquaducts", is responsible for all public infrastructure projects throughout the Empire - the most notable being public roads and aquaducts, but also including baths, governmental buildings, and many other things besides. While major projects are comissioned by the Emperor or their vassals and carried out by a small army of construction and maintenance workers and their overseers, the Praefectus is the one who collates and handles much of this information to ensure it's all running smoothly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_fav_beauty;Favourite Beauty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_fav_beauty_desc;The Favourite Beauty was the second most favoured of the Emperor's concubines, and occupied a position of much prestige and influence within his court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_brilliant_companion;Brilliant Companion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_brilliant_companion_desc;The Brilliant Companion was the first among the Emperor's concubines, and with this title came an enormous salary and clout. While in Han China this title was not fit for a spouse, the lack of a system of concubinage in the Byzantine Empire has allowed it to be seen as simply a title for the most favoured of the Emperor's companions, including their spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_taizi;Taizi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_taizi_desc;The Taizi is the heir-apparent of the Empire. While it can be translated as "Crown Prince", the Romans have long held a distaste for referring to their rulers by such regnal titles, and so have loaned the word in it's entirety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_kaisa;Kaisa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_kaisa_desc;A transliteration of "Caesar", the Kaisa is a prestigious title granted to a member of the Emperor's family. Taking from Diocletian's Tetrarchy, the Kaisa or Caesar would be the junior to the Augustus, and oversee a realm of their own to train them. In simpler terms, it is a title given to those being groomed for land of their own within the Empire and the second-in-line to succeed the entire Empire or a large segment within it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_great_qin_eunuch;Grand Attendant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_great_qin_eunuch_desc;While there are many eunuchs at the Imperial Court doing various functions, only a few ever directly make the Emperor's attention. The Grand Attendant is a personal eunuch whom serves the Emperor's court in a variety of functions, and occupies a position of authority over many others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_grand_pedagogue;Grand Pedagogue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_grand_pedagogue_desc;In Ancient Rome, the Pedagogue was a teacher for the various childen of a household. This name has been grafted onto the Chinese role of the Grand Tutor, a purely honourary office. The Grand Pedagogue is theoretically responsible for the education of children at court, though the actual Court Tutor is truly responsible for this alongside any assigned guardian. In reality, it is purely honourary, allowing the Emperor to appease a powerful but incompetent underling by granting them a dead-end title with no true clout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_fulin_patrikos;Patrikos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x	
title_fulin_patrikos_desc;Patrikos, the Greek term for Patrician, is a title inherited from the Roman Empire and utilised by the Byzantines. It holds much the same function now as it used to: an honourary title denoting a servant of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_fulin_hypatos;Hypatos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_fulin_hypatos_desc;Hypatos, the Greek term for Consul, is a title inherited from the Roman Empire and utilised by the Byzantines. It holds much the same function now in Fulin: an honourary title denoting a servant of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
title_daqin_patrician;Patrician;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_daqin_patrician_desc;A Patrician was a social class in the Roman Empire, being one from a noble family. The dilution of the importance of this term over the millenium from the Republic has left it largely vestigal, considering almost all rulers are nobility now by necessity. It still holds weight to be acknowledged as such formally by the Emperor, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_daqin_consul;Consul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_daqin_consul_desc;Originally the title given to the two rulers of the Roman Republic, it has long since been reduced in importance since those times. While a cornerstone of the Cursus Honorum and an important part of Roman culture which those of Daqin have adopted, it serves now as a purely superficial, honourary title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_excellency;Excellency;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
title_excellency_desc;The Three Excellencies were among the highest ranking ministers of Han China, serving as major council to the Emperor. Much like the titles of the Roman Empire of the same era, it has since become a term granted increasingly often to the point of being superficial. To be recognised as an Excellency, while still an honour, is nothing more than that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##GOVT & GOV FLAVOUR
western_chinese_government;Celestial Principate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
western_chinese_government_desc;Taking on practises of both the Byzantine and Roman Imperial systems and the Chinese beauracratic system, this new government form attempts to strike a balance between the two. A combination of exams similar to the Confucian style and military service similar to the Roman system can earn one citizenship, which in turn allows one to be eligible for land, power and titles. While the ruler has incredible power and can choose to model their succession on many available systems, from the more democratic elective systems to pure bloodline succession, should a poor ruler or a young child be in charge they risk violating the Mandate of Heaven - a philosophical concept which justifies the overthrowing of a bad ruler as divinely ordained, and could shatter the realm entirely should it be considered lost by the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
