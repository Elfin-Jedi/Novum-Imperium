DAQIN.00501.title;Colourful Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00501.desc;The new culture has resulted in new fashions. Fine Chinese silks, coloured cuffs and sashes along robes inspired by Greco-Roman cuts, accessorised with jewellery set with gemstones or blown glass. You could sport this new look, with a little funding to your tailor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00501.OPTA;They're beautiful. I'll wear it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00501.OPTB;A little gaudy, honestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00502.title;A Walk in the Park;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00502.desc;While out for a walk along a riverbank, you come across a group of people playing all manner of board games. Some Western, some Eastern, and some neither. The players greet you with a bow, and ask if you would grace them with a game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00502.OPTA;Sure, deal me in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00502.OPTB;I'd prefer to watch a round..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00502.OPTC;I'll pass, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00502.OPTD;Hold on, I recognise this one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00503.title;Victorious Match;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00503.desc;The rules were a little strange at first, but you picked them up through play quite quickly, and brought you a victory. The observers all let out a good natured cheer, and your opponent bursts out into a grin, shaking your hand and congratulating you on a good game, played well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00503.OPTA;What a pleasant afternoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00504.title;Outmanuevered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00504.desc;Though the game was tense, your opponent displays a greater aptitude, and you are forced to admit defeat. The onlookers tell you that you played well for one so inexperienced, though most of the praise goes to the victor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00504.OPTA;Good game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00504.OPTB;Flip the table and storm off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00505.title;Spectator Mode;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00505.desc;The game was gripping! One of the more experienced of the audience explained the rules to you as they came up - why this move was ingenious, that one a mistake, how fortunes could be turned with a little luck. Perhaps in the future there will be hundreds of people watching games such as this like one would a joust or chariot race?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00505.OPTA;Strategy and comradery on display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00506.title;A Moment of Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00506.desc;You walk on, and find a secluded spot a little further ways down the river. It's peaceful, and you take a while to simply relax among it all. \n When a retainer comes to get you at sunset, you smile for what feels like the first time in a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00506.OPTA;There are always bright spots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00507.title;A Moment of Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00507.desc;You walk on, following the river upstream, the sounds of civilisation fading behind you. The mind wanders in calm like this. \n You sit on a hilltop, offer a prayer to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], and focus on your breathing while you ponder some questions on your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00507.OPTA;Goodness, is that the time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00508.title;Master of the Craft;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00508.desc;You've experienced every game from here to the Middle Kingdom - you can see which this one descends from. You firmly trounce one opponent, then another, and soon soundly defeat every challenger for both honour and coin. You can probably get one more game in before you go - but what to tell them all as you do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00508.OPTA;"[Root.GetTitledFirstName] always wins.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00508.OPTB;"There was a lot of luck involved. Really!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00508.OPTC;Give them a few lessons with demonstration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00510.title;What's For Dessert?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00510.desc;Dinner was delicious. On this you, your family, and most of your court can all agree! But the question still remains, what to top it off with? A few favourites are bandied around, but your chef has gotten some new ingredients in recently. Perhaps it's time to try something more exotic? You ask for the shortlist of what's on offer, and peruse the options while you enjoy some drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00510.OPTA;The Nian Gao sounds nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nian_gao_info.TT;Nian Gao has been attested to since the times of Justinian the Great, around the 500's AD, in the times of the many Northern and Southern dynasties of China - it went by the name of Ye back then, and intrepid scholars of the culinary arts suspect it may go back even further. While it's traditionally eaten dring Chinese New Year, there's no reason you can't eat this sticky treat whenever you want it! Despite it's Eastern origins, the ingredients aren't actually all that exotic. Rome's trade with the East, especially India by way of the ocean, has meant Asian rice has been in the West for centuries, though it's cultivation wasn't common due to the conditions required - and the Nian Gao calls for a special kind of glutinous rice which is a lot rarer. Dates and chestnuts meanwhile are relatively common in the Levant and the mountainous regions of Anatolia. Being situated in the Eastern Mediterannean certainly comes with a diverse palette!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00510.OPTB;Kykeon? Well, you SHOULD keep healthy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kykeon_info.TT;Kykeon is a drink from Ancient Greece which was thought to aid in healing for both religious and practical reasons. All it's ingredients - barely, wine, goat's cheese, and honey - can be gotten quite easily from around Greece, including the wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00510.OPTC;Spartan Soup, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
black_broth_info.TT;The Byzantines were the latest to record an interpretation of the legendary Black Broth of the Spartans. It's a meal as harsh as the people who consumed it - no condiments other than salt and vinegar allowed! Legends say it can help you become a warrior on par with the Spartans, if you're able to stomach it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00510.OPTD;Surprise me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00510.OPTE;You have that particular Hunger again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00511.title;Nian Gao;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00511.desc;The sticky cake soon arrives on your plate, and you tuck in. Sticky here is the operative word - it gums up your mouth and makes talking more difficult than it has any right to be! A good time is had by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00511.OPTA;Perhaps I should make some myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00512.title;Kykeon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00512.desc;Kykeon straddles the line between a meal of food and a proper drink, akin to soup, drunk for health rather than enjoyment. This is reflected in the taste. The barley is still bitty and stuck in your teeth, the wine is dry and the honey doesn't help, even the cheese can be tasted seperate from the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00512.descHellenic;The drink of Homer's Heroes, Kykeon is a remedy for all that might ail you. Barely for health from the Goddess of seasons and a healthy outlook on life from the God of mirth's wine, with honey and cheese to top it off! The enthusiasm vanishes on your first sip. Tastes have changed since the Heroic Age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00512.OPTA;I hope I can keep it down...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00513.title;Black Soup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00513.desc;The dish presented to you is primarily pig's blood - the other ingredients are in a state of flux, the original recipe having been lost to time. It smells unappetising, it looks unappetising, and with your first mouthful you can confirm it tastes unappetising. Now you're expected to finish it at risk of being seen a coward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00513.OPTA;Just a few more mouthfuls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00514.title;Mystery Meal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00514.desc;You have absolutely no idea what's in this. To keep the surprise you order yourself blindfolded, so as to appreciate the flavour alone. The chef has prepared something experimental. Healing, harming, delicious, addictive, terrible... only one way to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00514.OPTA;Down the hatch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00515.title;A Shared Understanding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00515.desc;You whisper into the ear of your hand-picked chef. Minutes later, dessert is served. While not the thigh or shoulder of a true feast, a small platter in an appealing sauce is presented. It tastes a little like pulled pork, a nice contrast to the veal-like taste of a true cut. It satisfies something within you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00515.OPTA;The taste lingers on your tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00516.title;Implacably Peckish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00516.desc;You throw aside another meal. That wasn't it either! Since your mystery meal you've been trying to recapture how that meat tasted. It wasn't pork, beef, chicken, even exotic flamingo has failed to match it. Your stomach is constantly hollow, no matter how much you eat, even to the point of feeling bloated, but still you hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00516.OPTA;Buy even more exotic ingredients!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00516.OPTB;Try to forget about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00517.title;Dark Cravings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00517.desc;Your kitchen lies barren. Your quest to recapture your mystery dinner compels you to cook, even at this late hour. Tonight you are alone with your assistant, hastily chopping vegetables for a stew - too hastily. You cut your finger and on instinct put it to your mouth to catch the wound's blood. It's warm, metallic taste is immediately recognisable. And recognise it you do. \n \n There's only one meat you haven't tried yet. Your courtier's back is turned, and the knife still gleams in your hands. Your mouth waters at the thought, despite yourself. Is this what you have been driven to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00517.OPTA;Raise the knife, and make the first cut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00517.OPTB;No. Never again. [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00517.OPTC;That's ridiculous. This ends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00518.title;Satisfied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00518.desc;You carve a piece of their arm away and bite down. Your eyes widen, and you take another bite. You're Hungry. Ravenously Hungry. The juices drip from your chin. \n By morning, there's hardly a body left to find, only the various cuts of meat. You smile, satisfied in your knowledge and your finally satiated appetite. How did you not appreciate this delicacy sooner?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00518.OPTA;Now, who to invite for dinner next week...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00519.title;A Fit of Madness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00519.desc;Your senses snap back to you. What are you, a child obsessed with flights of fantasy? You lay down your knife and dress your wound. Whatever the meal was, there's nothing special about human flesh to drive you to this. There are many more explanations. Whatever it is, it's certainly not some kind of borderline obsessive craving for a meat you've certainly never tasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00519.OPTA;What an embarassing farce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00530.title;Valuable Cargo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00530.desc;While travelling by ship, as a ruler does, you go to leave your quarters only to find the exit barred and blocked. "You're more valuable as a prisoner than a passanger, sorry to say." says a sailor from behind the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00530.OPTA;How dare they?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00531.title;The Great Escape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00531.desc;You can't just sit on your laurels and wait to be ransomed - or worse. You've spent some time in your ship-based prison coming up with a plan. Considering your circumstances, you've narrowed it down to a few options...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00531.OPTA;Fight them all. Obviously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00531.OPTB;Make your escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00531.OPTC;Charm the captain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00531.OPTD;Be as Caesar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00532.title;The Only Thing They Fear is You;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00532.desc;The right moment arrives, and you strike. Bloodied fists, and then a bloodied sword. By the time you're finished, only an eighth of the original crew remain - and they're happy to carry you to the nearest port in exchange for their lives. The story of your victory spreads quickly, and isn't soon forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00532.OPTA;All in a day's work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00532.OPTB;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] surely blesses me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00533.title;Piratical Sabbatical;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00533.desc;By night's end you're re-captured, this time clapped in irons and under constant watch. When you reach port you've little choice but to pay them to let you go, and at a price worthy of one of your station. Being captured in battle is one thing, but this is another sure to leave a stain on your reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00533.OPTA;At least I'm alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00534.title;Dark Night, Calm Seas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00534.desc;While most of them are sleeping, you creep out of your room, avoid the patrol, then it's a hop, skip and jump to the ship's lifeboat, and you can sail away. They don't even notice the splash, and with the sea this calm and land this close, it'll be easy enough to row yourself back to shore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00534.OPTA;And not a drop of blood spilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00534.OPTB;And I sabotaged their ship for sunken salvage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00534.OPTC;And I took some cargo for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00535.title;O Captain, My Captain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00535.desc;The pirate captain accepts your invitation to dine with him. He's a far more charming man than you'd have imagined - he carries himself with confidence, but not arrogance. With your charms, he walks you safely down the gangplank at the next dock. Dawn's first light catching on the ocean, you place a hand on his shoulder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00535.OPTA;And kiss his cheek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00535.OPTB;And invite him to court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00535.OPTC;And draw your concealed dagger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00536.title;Caesarian Tactics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00536.desc;Like Caesar, you recite poetry for them. The poems spread ashore - containing a coded message for your spies. You tell the sailors calmly that they'll crucify them one day, and they laugh. When the next port contains a trap that leaves them YOUR captives, the smiles vanish. They turn to begs when nailed to a cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00536.OPTA;It worked for Caesar, it works for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00537.title;Dockside Goodbye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00537.desc;He presses a beautiful ring into your hands. "Keep it" he insists. "To remember me". \n The ship sails away, and you return to your life, one story richer if nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00537.OPTA;Your thumb brushes your ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00538.title;A Fine Catch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00538.desc;He's charmed you as much as you've charmed him. You urge him to return to court with you, and leave this life behind. He's hesitant at first, but when he looks into your eyes, a soft smile emerges. "With you? How can I refuse?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00538.OPTA;Onto the next adventure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00539.title;I'm the Captain Now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00539.desc;You pull your hidden dagger and plunge it into the brigand's stomach. He slumps at your feet and you let out your best 'damsel' scream. "Murder!" you cry, pointing at the ship. "And for my fortune!". Between the good and the greedy, the mob descends on the pirates. You're gone before the fires start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00539.OPTA;Pirate scum. I was only waiting for the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00539.OPTB;It's not due process exactly, but it's justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00540.title;Trouble in the Provinces;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00540.desc;You've recieved word of trouble brewing in one of the provinces, and  your presence has been requested to come and sort things out. It seems there's some kind of religious turmoil, and local attempts to quell it have failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00540.OPTA;I'll head on over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00540.OPTB;I'll head on over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00540.OPTC;I have more important things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.title;Fire And Brimstone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.desc;While a melting pot culture has emerged, the same is not true of religions. Militant zealots have taken to the streets and whipped the people into a frenzy! You consult with a few of the local magistrates to assess how best to deal with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.OPTA;Take out the troublemakers. Quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.OPTB;Let the zealots fight. We'll protect the rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.TT;While this will definitely work, this tactic might well break something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.OPTC;I will protect my Christian brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.OPTD;I will protect my Eastern brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.OPTE;Show them the third way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00541.OPTF;There are other options...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.title;Galilaee et Sramana;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.desc;While you may have legitimised Hellenism in your reign, this has not alleviated the religious conflicts in the Empire. Buddhists, Taoists, Christians of all stripes, and Hellenists all bear the scars of persecution and blame one another. Militant zealots have used this to boil these tensions over into violence - as their liege, however, they might listen to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.desc.old;Since the times of the ancient Roman Emperors, there has always been religious conflict within the Empire. The agreement reached upon to try and keep the peace was known as the Pax Deorum, the Peace of the Gods. Under this system, people could privately practise whatever religion they liked, so long as they participated in Roman festivals and didn't try to disrupt the religious function of the religion of the Roman state. In this way, Rome's Gods would still be honoured to bring prosperity to the Empire while it's citizens could still enjoy the appeasement of their local or household Gods. With the re-adoption of the old faith, the Pax Deorum has returned in one form or another across your realm - and with it has returned the Christians making trouble, as they did in the times of old, both before and after they became the majority and state-endorsed religion of the Empire. While Buddhists were certainly known to the Romans, as were many of the Indian philosophers among the centres of learning like Alexandria, they never existed in large enough numbers to be of any real trouble. With the influx of Eastern cultures and peoples into your newly emerging cultural melting pot, however, you're experiencing first-hand the zealotry that can come from the East. Taoists and Buddhists, the primary religions of the Chinese Emperors, have had their share of violence. The "Three Disasters of Wu" were a series of great persecutions by Chinese Emperors to drive out Buddhism from the entire region, for example. Meanwhile those of your own faith, the Hellenists, have found in some a desire for retribution of what they see as the destruction of their religion - and in this new world of holy wars, that desire finds an easy justification for a grass-roots persecution of all those who refuse to follow and honour the old Gods. The three way conflict is at a tipping point, a few fights have already broken out. As their liege, however, they might just listen to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.OPTA;"Friends, we are better than this squabbling...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.TTA;Romans have a long history of oration swaying crowds. You try your best to imitate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.OPTB;"We have been here before. Look to history...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.TTB;Diocletian attempted to persecute the Christians, and failed. The Wu tried to persecute the Buddhists, and failed. The Hellenists, despite being nearly wiped out, are still here. You appeal to history to try and dissuade them from the path of violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.OPTC;"The Jews and Muslims deserve this more!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.TTC;A common enemy unites people far more easily than a common cause. You offer the crowd an alternative, more acceptable outlet for their aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.OPTD;"Ares, guide my hand...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00542.TTD;Not fighting back on religious grounds nearly got your religion wiped out once. Never again. You support the Hellenists and resolve this violently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00543.OPTA;Bribe the rabble and rousers alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00543.OPTB;Look for a more permanent solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00543.OPTC;Send in the guard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00543.TT;This will work, but the violence as a result is liable to cause some damage and it'll cost some clout to give the order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00543.OPTD;What were the original options again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00544.title;Cooler Heads Prevail;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00544.desc;Violent voices are soon silent, crowds begin to disperse, and priests of your own try and guide the conversation. Within an hour, things do seem to have legitimately calmed down. Learned men talk of similarity and co-existence, while sermons are away from the rambunctious elements. You could listen to some of them yourself, if you wished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00544.OPTA;All's well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00544.OPTB;Listen to the Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00545.title;Better than Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00545.desc;When the steel is put away and the streets are cleared, few people come out of their homes. The bodies are moved out of the street, and you pray for rain to wash away the blood. Far fewer casualties than would have been caused by a full on revolt, but the tossed stones and the fire the mob caused in the fighting have caused no insignificant amount of damage. Only a gaunt quiet remains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00546.desc;You and your fellows, along with your guard, are able to rout the unbelievers. The revolt is soundly crushed before it has a chance to begin, and even now several people profess to follow your faith where they didn't before. Evidently the strength of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s followers has proven your point. Any who fight now lie dead, and it falls on you to decide what to do with the survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00547.desc;While you're familiar with the tenents of Christianity more generally, the Christians speak of the minutia of their religion with great conviction.

DAQIN.00560.title;A Third Path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00560.desc;Your study of faith has given you an opportunity to end these conflicts by finding a compromise between East and West. You quickly narrow down your possibilties to only two: either investigating Christianity which made it's way to China or finding a faith from Persia, a quite literal 'middle ground' between the two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00560.OPTA;Actually, maybe not now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00560.OPTB;I'll focus on Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00561.desc;The libraries have been scoured, the historical sources compiled, and any documents relating to the religions of East and West gathered. Your study is a maze, piles of books and scrolls taking up much of the space. The task here is going to be long and arduous, but hopefully worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00561.OPTA;The priests can handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00561.OPTB;Guess I best get started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00565.desc;The culmination of a year of research, revision, collation and investigation lies before you. A mix of people, learned and lay, bickering over their religious differences once again.

DAQIN.00566.title;The Third Way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00566.descXtian;Known as the Luminous Faith to the Chinese, Christianity did go to the Middle Kingdom. As you appeal to this bridge that is the Nestorian faith, more and more of them seem convinced. Seeds are planted in their minds, which will grow in time. The situation is defused, and you are left with the decision of whether to officially adopt this new religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00566.descMani;Mani considered himself to be an Apostle of Christ and a teacher of Buddha's way. This 'Religion of Light', as he called it, is what you introduce to these people to show that their beliefs are compatible. While none convert on the spot, this has defused the situation. But will you adopt Mani's teachings openly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00566.OPTA;I cannot do so openly. Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00567.desc;Your arguments fall on deaf ears, and both sides accuse you of being a heretical agent sent to undermine them.

All that time and effort, and the only thing you have to show for it are broken windows and an angry populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00567.OPTA;Damn it all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00568.title;Following the New Way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00568.desc;Your attempts to spread your new faith have borne fruit: there are new converts, enthusiastic in a way they're unlikely to be again. This could be an oppurtunity to spread your faith across the land further than you might expect. They look to you for guidance - and a decree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00568.OPTA;Forcibly convert the unbelievers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00569.title;Pax Deorum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00569.desc;The arguments land true. In due time, the Christians, pagans and Easterners have all found some common ground. People continue their own practises in private or their houses of worship, and life seems to return to it's normality and peace. The Pax Deorum worked for Rome, and with a little intervention to keep it moving, it seems to work now as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A gift is bought before you for this week's: a shipment of fireworks from one of the guilds in your demesne. They would be a spectacle to keep the peasants happy and bring in traders, while the guild happily accepts the free publicity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00551.OPTA;Sure, that sounds fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00553.title;Festival Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00553.desc;The night comes, and you enjoy the music and festivities. You give a short speech as is traditional, and then throw your arms out. Above the crowd's heads colourful explosions light up the sky, then fizzle as the embers disappear into the cool night air. When the festivities finally draw to a close and people begin heading back home, they do so with a smile on their faces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00553.OPTA;A night to remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00552.title;Horrid Experiments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00552.D;Another pig carcass is bought into your test chamber. The scholars claim that the pig's flesh is most like that of man's, and so when testing weapons it proves the best substitute. Your mixture is loaded into a clay pot, a lid put on with a hole, which is filled with a short length of rope. The length is set alight, the pot thrown, and from a safe distance you watch your new creation. The loud bang, the explosion, and the greek fire spreading everywhere burn through the pig's flesh in short order - blood seeps from wounds caused by embedded pottery shrapnel, and the fire is thrown around the body as well. The whoosh of flame and the explosion used to propel it create a draft which draws the fire both to it's target in a small vortex and down wind passages - you've had to clear the hallways nearby too, as the hallways sometimes conflagerate depending on the conditions. You and your military engineers are hailing this a success, but are interrupted by screaming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.005521.D;A young servant has gone to douse the flames - but water does not extinguish Greek Fire. The mixture catches his clothes, and he stumbles back, trying to put it out. Having been carrying around several of the components his hands soon spark and catch fire too. He screams in anguish, falling to his knees, as the fire and it's naptha base begin burning through his skin. It's as if the fire is stuck to him, and no matter how he attempts to smother it it rages on. You order for nobody to help him despite his pleas, lest they fall to the flame too - and you're all forced to bear witness to the writhing form of what was once a man not just burn, but melt, his skin sloughing off the bone. The smell as it engulfs his hair is indescribably wretched, as is the sizzling snap and crack of his body - not that he is dead. He continues to writhe and make noises for several seconds after most of him is fire, only stopping when one of your soldiers retrieves a crossbow and fires it through the boy. Any jubilation is gone. War is brutal, but this weapon is something wicked even beyond the usual means. When the fires burn themselves out, leaving a blackened skull with charred flesh still sticking to it and smouldering, you're looked to for guidance: is this a weapon you can really justify using?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.005521.OPTA;You will begin production immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAQIN.00574.desc;The Eastern tradition has many exceptional women to pull from, all based in history much closer to the present than the distant Greek Myth or even the fall of the Han. While no less patriarchal than the West, the exploits of those women who were able to defy the odds and earn their place in history would serve well to legitimise your ruler as a woman who has done much the same.
