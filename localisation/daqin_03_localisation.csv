DAQIN.00302.title;The Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00302.desc;The ruler of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName], much like the ruler of China, is beholden to the Mandate of Heaven: the notion that they only have a right to rule for as long as they rule well. Should they fail, heaven will select someone to ovethrow them. Whispers that you are failing to fulfill this Mandate have become outright accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00302.desc.old;The ruler of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName], much like the ruler of China, has almost limitless power - but it comes at a cost. The ruler takes on the Mandate of Heaven, and in doing so must embody a good ruler: wise, even-handed, just, reflecting their subjects beliefs and embodying a civilised culture, and so on. If ever this is to faulter, their rule would be considered illegitimate - their vassals would have not only the justification but the duty to rebel. Where once there were whispers, now there are outright accusations. It would appear many think you have lost this Mandate. Control over your realm and the legitimacy of your entire rule are slipping away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00302.OPTA;I must change. There is no second chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00302.OPTB;I am still Emperor! Let them come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00303.title;Supplication to the Son of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00303.desc;Kowtowing to the Emperor of China is a sign of submission. As the [From.GetEmperorEmpress] of Daqin, you have declared yourself to be an equal to the Middle Kingdom. Submitting to them now would call into question the legitimacy of your rule, your judgement, and your realm itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00303.OPTA;I shan't go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00303.OPTB;I'll go anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00304.title;The Child [From.GetEmperorEmpress];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00304.desc;A mere [From.GetBoyGirl] cannot be [From.GetEmperorEmpress]. The realm has seen the ascension of a child to the throne of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] as a sign that the Mandate of Heaven is violated. While some remain loyal, there is no doubt: the succession will be determined not by blood, but by might and divine luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00304.OPTA;Felicior Augustus, melior Trajan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00305.title;The Mandate is Broken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00305.desc;The signs are clear, the word is out, and the unspoken agreement is reached: the Mandate of Heaven has been lost. Even now, vassals of the old regime move to seize the Empire, and power plays begin within the courts to usurp it from the inside out. Just as China and old Rome of ages past, a time of crisis has arrived, usurpers spring from around every corner, and everyone from single cities tucked into the hillside to vast Kingdoms assert their independence. If you have your own imperial ambitions, or desire for independence, now would be a good time to realise them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00305.OPTA;The [From.Liege.GetTitle] is no longer my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00305.OPTB;I will remain loyal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00305.OPTC;All is lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00306.title;A New [From.GetEmperorEmpress];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00306.desc;A new hand has claimed the Mandate of Heaven, and taken up residence in the royal palace. Only time will tell if the new dynasty will prove to bring new life and rejuvination to lead the realm into a golden age, becoming the 'Restitutor Orbis' as Aurelian before them, or merely another usurper who will be ousted by the warlords plagueing the land. For now, they have the support of their vassals - it would seem any oppurtunity to stitch the realm back together is preferable to the chaos. Might is all that matters to one's legitimacy in these troubled times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00306.OPTA;Felicior Augustus, melior Trajan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00306.TT;You cannot lose the mandate for as long as this character reigns. You gain the trait ùYRestitutorù!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00307.title;The Mandate Reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00307.desc;Years ago, [Root.GetName] was thought to have lost the Mandate of Heaven. Heaven, it seems, did not agree. With the death and defeat of any and all other warlords and rulers whom sought to claim [From.PrimaryTitle.GetBaseName] from [Root.GetHerHim], none can deny that the Mandate is firmly within [Root.GetName]'s hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00307.OPTA;Hail to the [From.GetTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kinslayer_removal_explanation.TT;Any stains of ùYKinslayingù! upon you are removed. By failing to usurp your rule they have forsaken their filial nature to you, in accordance with the Confucian principle of the Five Relationships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandate_explanation.TT;A ruler should avoid regencies, running a deficit of money, prestige and piety, ensure they are of the right faith and culture, being an evil person, or anything else that might illegitimise their rule. It may be the case that you cannot avoid any of these things in time. If none of these things can be changed, rebellion may be inevitable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandate_reclaiming_explanation.TT;While it may take years, you can reclaim your mandate by killing or unlanding all non-family members with claims to the Empire. Should you succeed, all stains of kinslaying will be wiped away, and your rule will never break again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
