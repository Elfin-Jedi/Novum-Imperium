###REALM EVENTS###
DAQIN.00201.title;The Fulin Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00201.desc;New banners have been raised onto the buildings that are a blend of Han and Greek architecture. Soldiers with arms and armour from both Empires, in some cases new blends of the two, march in procession. Officials take in newly minted currency bearing Chinese characters on one side and the Greek alphabet on the other, with the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress]'s face upon it. The Imperial Palace in Constantinople is no longer the seat of the Byzantine Empire but of Fulin, its Sino-Greek replacement. A member of the Chinese Emperor's own family has bought a sword to present to the [From.GetEmperorEmpress] of Fulin, and their name and descendents will be remembered forever as having changed the very conception of where East and West begin and end - and what those seperations even mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00201.OPTA;The world will never be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00202.title;The Dragon of the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00202.desc;The Roman Empire was considered by the Chinese to be a power rivalling their own. Now their distant, Westernised cousins have proven this to be correct, creating an Empire which equals even the ancient Han in splendour, power and renown. With the declaration from Rome of the adoption of the Empire's Chinese name, Daqin, it is asserted to the entire world that the Roman Empire is no longer confined to history and imagination. Great works of art have been produced, and already efforts are underway to uncover the ancient and glorious pasts of both East and West. Never again will the world be allowed to fall to barbarism and chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00202.OPTA;When the Western Dragon roars, the world trembles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
##HOLIDAY EVENTS##
DAQIN.00203.D;With the realm at peace, I'm finding I have a lot of free time on my hands. Maybe it's time to take a break from my duties and see the rest of my realm, or even the world beyond my borders?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00203.OPTA;I shall explore the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00203.OPTB;I shall head to the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00203.OPTC;I'll stay home for my break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00203.OPTD;I've still got work to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00204.D;It can be easy to forget the simple joys of noble life. Hunting, fishing, watching a sunset, time with the horses. After my break, I feel ready to face the world again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00204.OPTA;One must stop to smell the roses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00205.D;If I'm going on holiday, I'll need some company! But who is going with me? Besides my most trusted servants and attendants, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00205.OPTA;My family, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00205.OPTB;Everyone from my extended family is welcome to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00205.OPTC;I'll bring my closest friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00205.OPTD;I don't have anyone to invite...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002051.D;Spending time with my lover has been an absolute joy. It's times like this that I truly believe I could spend my life with them. Away from here, in private, I could conduct a small ceremony to bond us in matrimony, without the scandal of doing so publically...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002051.OPTA;I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002051.OPTB;Our love is purer without the expectations of marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002051.OPTC;Alas, they are a ruler in their own right, unable to avoid the scandal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00206.D;After a few days, I'm really feeling how alone I am. Why go and see these sights if I have nobody to share them with? Why make memories if I'm the only one to whom they'll matter? Nobody in the whole world wants to spend time with me. I can't blame them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00206.OPTA;I'm going back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00207.D;My spouse has insisted upon bringing a special friend with them. While they are both of the same sex, I find them embracing often, and choosing to share a bed with one another. While this isn't unusual in this day and age, the longing glances they cast at one another are making me suspect...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00207.OPTA;That they know my struggles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00207.OPTB;That they are a sodomite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00207.OPTC;That they must be the best of friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00207.OPTD;That they're happy together, and that's wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002071.D;The evening on holiday draws to a close, as my spouse and I chat about our experiences. Away from the prying eyes of society, both of us can be more honest about who we are, including our mutual struggles on who we love. Our lovers join us openly, in a way they never could at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002071.OPTA;I trust them with my secret, and vice versa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00208.D;My lover has asked me if they can accompany me on my holiday, so we can spend quality time together. Obviously arranging this will be difficult, since my spouse is likely to notice. But to be away from my flower for so long...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00208.OPTA;My spouse doesn't seem to care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00208.OPTB;I'll just bring them both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00208.OPTC;I'll have to leave my lover behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00208.OPTD;My spouse will understand, if I tell them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00209.D;With all the preperations made, it's time to set off on holiday! My regent will ensure the realm doesn't fall apart in my absence. Probably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00209.OPTA;Goodbye, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00209.TT;Make sure you've got a regent! You'll be away for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00211.D;While travelling through the country, I come across a plateu that seems absolutely perfect for letting my horse stretch its legs. The sun is high, the breeze is cool, it seems the perfect time for a ride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00211.OPTA;Keep at a canter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00211.OPTB;Giddy up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00212.D;Whilst staying in a foreign city, my entourage and I decide to head out in the evening for a few drinks, and to chat with the locals. The burghers are a different sort from the peasants, and not entirely unpleasant. As we leave, one of my companions asks me what I want most out of the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00212.OPTA;To look my best, for myself and others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00212.OPTB;To hit up the brothel afterwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00212.OPTC;Spend as much time with them as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00212.OPTD;Get back to my books as soon as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00213.D;Being away from home for so long makes me miss the familiarity. These new places are fun and exciting and interesting! But I miss my own bed, and my own food, and hearing my own language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00213.OPTA;I'll head home early.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00213.TT;This will end your holiday early.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00213.OPTB;These feelings will pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00214.D.W;Whilst travelling around Europe, a great marble building comes into view over a hill. It's done in a classical style, and there are inscriptions in Latin on it. This must be a Roman ruin! Whilst one of my servants lays down a blanket for us to picnic outside of it, I can't help but admire the ancient monument and the empire who built it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00214.D.E;Whilst travelling around China, the tell-tale octagonal stacks of a pagoda come into view over the hill. A pair of Nio, the muscle-bound guardians of the Buddha, stand out front. The pagoda seems unused, but one of my scholars says it likely dates back to the era of the Han Dynasty! I can't help but admire the ancient monument and the empire who built it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00214.OPTA;There is so much of the past we do not know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00214.OPTB;One day, perhaps we will match their achivements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00214.OPTC;They fell, to make way for better things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00214.OPTD;The methods of construction are fascinating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00215.D;On a lazy afternoon, I take a wander through the local market. This far from home, there are so many exotic goods and foods, the smell fills my nose and the colours dazzle me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00215.OPTA;I'll buy a snack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00215.OPTB;I'll buy a souvenir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00215.OPTC;I'm just looking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00215.OPTD;I'll try some trading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00215.TT;Based on your §Gstewardship§! and §Bdiplomacy§!  skills, you might gain or lose gold or artifacts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00216.D;The sound of music and singing fills the air tonight. The peasants are dancing around a fire, enjoying some kind of local festival. People swap partners regularly, and play strange stringed instruments. Some of them invite me, with gestures more so than words, to join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00216.OPTA;I'll dance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00216.OPTB;I'll try an instrument!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00216.OPTC;I'll just enjoy the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00217.D;While travelling, an arrow lands at my feet. My entourage draw their weapons, and my hand goes to my sword. "Your money or your life!" comes the call, as ragged-looking figures emerge from the trees, bows and sickles at the ready. Brigands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00217.OPTA;Taste steel, knaves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00217.OPTB;Hide under the wagon until it's over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00217.OPTC;Leg it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00217.OPTD;This'll be just like the simulations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00218.D.E;While travelling, I come across a Buddhist temple. A large carving of the Buddha dominates an open space, where a few monks attend to the maintaining of the temple. One of them approaches me with a bow, and asks if they can offer hospitality to a weary traveller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00218.D.W;While travelling, I come across an abbey. A large carved depiction of Christ on the cross dominates the internal space, and a few of the monks mill about attending to the abbey. A portly gentleman asks if they can offer hospitality to a weary traveller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00218.OPTA.MATCH;I'm more interested in talking theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00218.OPTA.DIFF;I'm love to learn about your faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00218.OPTB;Thank you for your charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00218.OPTC;Not without a sizeable donation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00218.OPTD;I am the [Root.GetTitle], I don't accept 'charity!' Begone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00219.D;While travelling through a forest, a local noble rides past. She tells me she's on a hunt, and asks if I and my entourage would like to join her. It's a good day for it, and her forests are apparently rich with game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00219.OPTA;Hunting a little something sounds fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00219.OPTB;It's one of my favourite things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00219.OPTC;So long as I can bring my winged help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00219.OPTD;Only if we get to hunt something dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
##REGENT EVENTS##
DAQIN.01221.D;In the absence of their ruler, the realm's tax collectors grow selfish and the merchants grow greedy. If this continues, the whole realm's economy might suffer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01221.OPTA;Time to remind them who's in charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01222.D;The peasants are demanding a return of the rightful sovereign! Why do they even care?! They're practically up in arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01222.OPTA;I'll show THEM the violence inherent in the system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01223.D;The spiritual lords about the realm are beginning to grow displeased with our ruler's absence. They're asserting more control over temporal affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01223.OPTA;One day this is going to cause an incident...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01224.D;The soldiers grow rowdy, and the generals ambitious. This military sloppiness could spell doom for the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01224.OPTA;You're soldiers, not mercenaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01225.D;Regardless of all else, the sovereign was a unifying figure to the people. Without them, co-operation and the exchange of ideas is becoming more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01225.OPTA;We should encourage people to work together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01226.D;The realm is, to everyone's collective surprise, running smoothly. Well, as smoothly as it usually is anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.01226.OPTA;In large part to my efforts as regent, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
##QIN TOMB EVENTS##
DAQIN.00220.D;A courier dismounts before me, and hurries a message with my regent's wax seal on it. The latest update from home! I hope the realm's okay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00220.OPTA;The letter unfolds before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00221.D;In your absence, the realm's merchants grow greedy and powerful. The guilds believe themselves masters in your absence! Please return to us soon, the realm's economy suffers without you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00222.D;The peasantry are beginning to demand your return, sire. I fear we may be looking at armed revolt if you do not return - or, worse, a general strike! Please return to us soon to set them at ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00223.D;Spiritual concerns may be far from your mind, but they are always on the minds of your spiritual subjects. Your absence is considered an ill omen for religious and temporal concerns. Please, return to us soon to assuage their fears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00224.D;Without you to lead our armed forces, the generals grow ambitious and the soldiers ill-moraled. I fear it may descend into them being practically mercenary! Please, return to us soon to restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00225.D;Our scientific advancement is reliant upon the exchange of ideas between peoples. Without you to act as a unifying figure, progress is slowed by men of greed and small mind! Return to us soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00226.D;All is well at home! I hope your project is progressing as smoothly as your realm has been progressing under my watchful eye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00231.D;While travelling through the Middle Kingdom, I find a few peasants sorting through shards of terrecotta they found buried in a mound. They offer to sell some to me for a pittance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00231.OPTA;I can sell these on for a profit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00231.OPTB;They'll look lovely on my mantle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00231.OPTC;With a little silver, they'll dig for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00232.D;In a few hours, which I spent enjoying the landscape and a glass of wine, the peasants return with more treasures. Including an... entire terracotta head? It's from a statue. Something is buried here, under the mound!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00232.OPTA;I must remember to come back here sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00232.TT;A new §Ydecision§! will be available to you when you get back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00233.D;The route is planned, the supplies are packed, and the horses are saddled. I'm going to find out what's under that mound!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00233.TT;This will take you away from court for several years. While you're unlikely to die on the trip, you should appoint a trustworthy, healthy, competent regent in your absence. The longer you are away, the more the realm will start to fall apart in your absence, so make sure it can last without you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00233.OPTA;Let's go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00233.OPTB;I'll hold off or now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00234.D;Finally, I've arrived back at the mound. If I'm to excavate this properly, it's going to need manpower and equipment, both of which the locals can provide. How much expense can the treasury bare for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00234.OPTA;I will spare no expense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00234.OPTB;All things in moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00234.OPTC;Slow and steady wins the race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00235.D;Communication and oversight is tantamount to a successful project of any kind. This excavation is no different. While I speak enough Chinese to get by, my dialect is foreign to these people, as am I. I should really see about hiring a foreman. But what kind of foreman do I want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00235.OPTA;A loyalist, who will always enact my will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00235.OPTB;A miner, who will keep the needs of the workers in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00235.OPTC;An old soldier, to keep the rabble in line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00236.D;Disaster! The dreadful weather this week has caused a small collapse. A few souls were trapped underneath, and we could only retrieve their bodies. The foreman tells me that accidents like this are likely to happen again if we don't take extra precautions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00236.OPTA;We should preserve life, even if it takes longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00236.OPTB;Haste is still our priority. Accidents happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00237.D;The workers for my excavation have grown discontent. What started as upset grumblings has turned into a full blown strike. They refuse to dig any further unless I increase their pay and decrease their working hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00237.OPTA;Inspire them with words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00237.OPTB;Break the strike by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00237.OPTC;Go, then. We'll hire fresh hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002381.D;With honeyed words and the promise of the rewards and glory that uncovering whatever's below will yield, you pass around an extra ration of baijiu and everyone gets back to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002381.OPTA;Sometimes people just need to know there's a plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002382.D;Your speech did not go as expected. Cynical voices lead the worker's response, and they demand written contracts. "No more empty promises!" a ringleader calls. Your foreman looks at you with concern. Words aren't going to cut it here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002382.OPTA;Give in to their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002382.OPTB;Sod it, kill them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002382.OPTC;Renegotiate the terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002382.TT;This will depend on your stewardship skill. It will cost nothing but time - but might cost a lot of time if it goes poorly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002383.D;You give a signal, and arrows pierce the crowd. There's a scream, and those workers loyal to you wage in. What follows is brief, and bloody, but effective. "To live" is an effective answer when asked what someone gets out of working for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002383.OPTA;Now get back to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00239.D;A cheer comes from one of the pits. The workers have apparently struck through to some kind of underground tomb! This bit of tangible progress is the cause of much rejoicing. Results keep conversation going through the night, and redouble efforts come morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00240.D;As word has spread that what you're investigating is a tomb, some religious objects about disturbing the dead have been raised. You are, after all, graverobbing, and these Eastern folk have very strict rules about respecting their family and venerating their ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00240.OPTA;Argue from theology;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00240.OPTB;Appeal to their greed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00240.OPTC;Ignore their complaints;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00240.OPTD;Call in religious specialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002401.D;While it doesn't convince everyone, your arguments convince enough people that work continues. The few who trickle out are soon replaced by those of less strict scruples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00241.D;A harrowing scream comes from the tomb, and a corpse is dragged out from it. a gaping wound in his side. Evidently, those who built this place didn't want it robbed: the tomb is booby trapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00241.OPTA;Stand back - I'll clear it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00241.OPTB;Be careful, everyone. Take your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00241.OPTC;Press on. Accidents happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002411.D;Courage and foolishness can often be two sides of the same coin. For you, in this moment, you begin to suspect you've displayed the latter. A tripwire pings off beneath your feet, and you barely have time to look up before you - and all that you've uncovered - are buried under several tons of rock and rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.002411.OPTA;May my successor have better luck...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00243.D;You're approached by a crowd of workers, your foreman leading them. They offer respectful bows, thanking you for never considering them expendable. Your foreman asks if they can take the tomb's spoils, as a reward for them having done all the work of uncovering it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00243.OPTA;It seems approprite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00243.OPTB;That wasn't what was agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00244.D;Your workers, brandishing tools in hand, form a line in front of the tomb. They demand to be able to take it's spoils, having been the ones to uncover it. Behind them is the foreman, bound and gagged, unable to assist you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00244.OPTA;Try and talk them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00244.OPTB;Take it, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00244.OPTC;The only thing you'll get is steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00245.D;Wordlessly, the peasants surround the entrance to the tomb, makeshift weaponry from their tools pointed at you. Your foreman leads them, an axe in hand, and steps forward to talk. "It's time for you to leave, sire. We've all had enough of your tyranny.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00245.OPTA;Can't we talk this out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00245.OPTB;What do you all want, a reward?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00245.OPTC;Is my being royalty not enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00246.D;Negotiations having thoroughly broken down, due at least in part to your own poor treatment of these people, violence is the only way forward. The mob's leader raises his axe, charging at you, and your own weapon comes out of it's sheathe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00246.OPTA;Meet the mob with ferocity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00246.OPTB;Shoot him down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00246.OPTC;Devour! DEVOUR!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00247.DA;The few guards you have charge with you, and each of you cuts down near a dozen men. You are armed, armoured, and trained. The same is not true of your foes. By the time it's over, you're standing above a field of bodies, the last few stragglers running to the hills or trying to crawl to safety, and being granted death by a sword through the chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00247.DB;A sound like striking thunder rips through the air. The mob visibly recoils at the sound - their leader drops dead on the spot, a gaping hole in his chest, as does the man behind him. You recognise the word for 'demon' being among the things that are yelled as the superstitious peasants flee in abject terror from your gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00247.DC;Animalistic hunger fills you, and you leap at the mob's leader entirely unlike a man. Teeth rend flesh from bone, and he screams in horror, gargling on his own blood, as you rip chunks of red meat from the new wound. Wide-eyed and frenzied, a scarlet smile meets your now fear-paled would-be attackers. \n The few who don't run meet similarly grisly, delicious, ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00247.OPTA;That takes care of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00248.DA;It seems like you've really gotten through to the peasants, and a few break out into smiles. You're welcomed into the mausoleum, and begin to examine what's within... when the sound of broken rock comes from behind you, and all sunlight vanishes. "If you want those riches so bad, enjoy them!" comes a voice from the other side. You're trapped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00248.DB;There are a lot of foes. Too many. You're taken down by a dozen hands, beaten, kicked, and spit on. For a moment, you fear death, but instead you're dragged into the Mausoleum. "If you care so much for the riches, then have them." one of the ringleaders says. As you pull yourself to your feet, the sound of collapsing stone comes from behind you, leaving you in darkness. You're sealed in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00248.OPTA;Perhaps there's a back door on the other end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00249.D;There's some nods in agreement. A little bit of internal debate. Until, finally, the peasantry step aside. A ringleader tells you that they will all honour their word, for the sake of honour, and piety, and not being haunted by a vengeful tomb ghost, among other such high-minded ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00249.OPTA;All the more for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00250.D;Grins spread like disease across the crowd, and they cheer and chatter in a half dozen dialects. You watch as they emerge carrying fine jewels, piles of gold, silken robes and impressive weaponry. There must've been a fortune in there! Several! Finally, your time comes to enter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00250.OPTA;If they haven't taken the walls, too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00251.D;Stepping over the corpses, you wipe the blood from your weapon, and put it back in it's sheathe. Still-open, shocked eyes stare up at you from the floor as you enter the mausoleum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00251.OPTA;If only this could be the fate of all my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00252.T;Within the Mound;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00252.D;This isn't just a tomb. It's closer to a necropolis! There's entire series of steps, wider than one person would ever need, and connecting tunnels - some newly dug, others between large 'pits'. You walk alongside one absolutely filled with skeletal remains - lots of skulls and ribcages. These were seperate people, and none are in one piece. What little fabric clings to them is of fine silks, and jewellery is scattered among them. Chips and breakages in the bone indicate these people died violenty. Likely unwillingly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00252.OPTA;Buried alongside their ruler, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAIQN.00253.T;Deeper into the Necropolis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00253.D;Continuing on, you pass by walls built of brick, as tall as you are. The tunnel goes straight through one, evidently broken by your miners. Was this a city once? Was it ever designed to be lived in? Stepping through a doorway takes you through a fully furnished palace, coated in dust. The style seems familiar, but not overly familiar. Whoever built these, they had a style similar but distinct from the current Chinese style. Judging by the damage, they're old. Is this the only palace down here? It would've been fit for a king, once. Maybe more than a king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00253.OPTA;If only it were on the surface...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00254.T;The Terracotta Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00254.D;Among these ruins, still illuminated only by your torch light, are what you could almost mistake for a castle, or a regimental ground. It's here you see something truly astonishing: the Terracotta you found wasn't from a few statues. It was from an army. They stretch out before you, hundreds of uniquely detailed people, with their own intricately made armour, the paint on them flaking and fading but still present in places. Horses are here too, just as detailed and unique as their riders, and their weapons - though broken now - are obviously very real. These statues must all have been real soldiers at one point. An entire army, here, defending their monarch even in the afterlife. This is the kind of magnificent defence an Emperor should have! Perhaps when you get back, you will get a personal guard to model your own clay soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00254.OPTA;What an amazing sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00255.T;Heart of the Tomb;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00255.D.F;Finally, you enter past golden gates, into a room that defies belief. A full map of the world, with rivers of flowing quicksilver still going after all this time, lies before you. The walls and floors are piled high with all manner of gold, jewels, clothing, weapons and armour, paintings and calligraphies, even books. Some of the pots contain food, now long since decayed. At the centre of the room - and thus, at the centre of the world - is a coffin. Within lies a man, preserved behind glass, dressed in the fineries of eras long gone by. Murals depict him subjugating a dozen peoples, and proclaim his name: Qin Shi Huang. This man was the first Emperor of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00255.D.L;Finally, you enter past golden gates, into a room that defies belief. A full map of the world, with rivers of flowing quicksilver still going after all this time, lies before you. You suspect there was once treasure in here judging by the few coins and jewels remaining, but your workforce has carried it off. Only the rotted food and broken arms and armour remain. At the centre of the room - and thus, at the centre of the world - is a coffin. Smashed glass lies in shards on the inside - someone has taken whoever once resided in it. Murals depict a figure subjugating a dozen peoples, and proclaim his name: Qin Shi Huang. This was the rest place of the first emperor of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00255.OPTA;Now what to do with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00255.OPTB;No way out, though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00256.D;You take a moment to rest and recouperate, looking at all the riches around you. You couldn't possibly cart all of it back, but you could definitely take something. If you wanted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00256.OPTA;No. This place must be resealed, out of respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00256.OPTB;This isn't mine to take, it belongs to the Chinese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00256.OPTC;Maybe a little something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00257.D;The treasures here glimmer in your torchlight. To the victor, the spoils! But what to take? There is more gold, silver and precious gems than you've ever seen in your entire life, larger than the treasuries of even the richest realms. There are artifacts that could fill up an entire courtroom. Or, of course, there is the most unique thing here: the Emperor himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00257.OPTA;I'll take the riches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00257.OPTB;I want the artifacts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00257.OPTC;Only the coffin matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00257.OPTD;His body is the final ingredient to immortality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.D.4;All this is incredible, but you're still trapped down here! You're underground, so there's only going to be so much air. If you don't get out in time, it could spell disaster! \n \n The air doesn't feel thin right now, no matter how noxious and damp it smells.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.D.3;No use! If you don't hurry, you'll be stuck in this tomb, just as dead as its last inhabitant! \n \n The air here  is growing thinner. You can feel your breaths getting deeper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.D.2;No use! If you don't hurry, you'll be stuck in this tomb, just as dead as its last inhabitant! \n \n You struggle to breathe. Already, you feel light headed. Your lungs panic in your chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.D.1;Desperately, you wrack your brain for any other ideas. But your thoughts are sluggish, your body is exhausted, and you feel oh so very tired...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.OPTA;There's alchemy down here, I can make something explosive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.OPTB;Digging my way out seems sensible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.OPTC;Maybe an opening can be made small enough to squeeze out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00258.OPTD;I'll rest... just for a moment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00259.D;Slumping against a wall, you close your eyes and try, in vain, to catch your breath. Your last thoughts are of home, so very distant now. You attempt a prayer, but slump to your side before you can complete it, the last vestiges of life leaving you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00259.D.I;Being immortal, of course, you won't die. You can't die. Even if it will feel like dying. But you can wait. You have, after all, all the time in the world. Ensuring the coffin is empty of any obstruction, you lay down inside, and get as comfortable as you can. In time, someone else will open this tomb, and find an Emperor within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00259.OPTA;Now, the endless rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00260.D;Sunlight! And fresh air! It feels like breathing soup, so thick and full is it to me now! Clearing the last few pieces of rubble away, I clamber out the top of the mound, not a threat in sight. The tomb's free for me to do what I want with it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00260.OPTA;But what will that be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00261.D;It's been eventful, but with the Necropolis of Qin Shi Huang finally uncovered, and my course for it set, it's high time to head home. I wonder how many more wonders are hidden throughout the world, just waiting to be uncovered? With one last look at my impression of the Terracotta Army, I set off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00261.OPTA;I hope the realm's okay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00261.TT;Upon returning home, inspired by the Terracotta Army, you'll have access to a new decision to form your own vassal mercenary band.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00263.D;Entering back into your palace, the court grows silent. Wordlessly, you sit yourself down in pride of place once more. It fits, just like it used to. Your court bows. It's like you never even left. News spreads quickly of your return, and most of the problems caused by your absence die down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00263.OPTA;Thank your regent, and issue your decree of return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00263.OPTB;Reward your faithful regent with some land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00267.D;Your councillors lead your regent away, and you find yourself with a brief moment of peace. The hustle and bustle of the palace is distant, and once again you sit in pride of place. Being away is nice, but this is where you belong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00267.OPTA;Maybe a warm bath after all this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00270.T;Tyrian Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00270.D;A new personal guard occupies the palace of the Western Dragon. Clad in Tyrian Purple cloth and wearing armour composed of scale and lamellar, these fearsome troops are loyal only to the Emperor. Whispers go up of these being a new Praetorian, not least because of their striking imperial colour. No expense has been spared in their creation or recruitment, comprised of only the best soldiers from anywhere the realm's influence may reach. Although designed as a palace garrison, they will accompany the Emperor wherever they go, on or off the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00270.OPTA;Another bow to the Emperor's quiver...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00271.D.W;Already, reports are laid out on your desk, along with a glass of wine. The realm might be in a little bit of crisis, what with the war on, but there's really no place you'd rather be. If your ancestors could do it, so can you! With a flourish, you put quill to paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00271.D.P;Already, reports are laid out on your desk, along with a glass of wine. Birds chirp in the peace, the sun shines over a brand new day, and there's nowhere you'd rather be. With a smile and a flourish you, put quill to paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00271.OPTA;A ruler's work is never done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00272.D;An emissary from China has arrived. He says that the Chinese are thankful for the respect you showed the Tomb of Qin Shi Huang. It's since been occupied by their own historians, and is being uncovered. As a sign of gratitude, the Emperor offers a gift. A heavy, ornately decorated box is laid at your feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00272.OPTA;I hope it's something educational!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00272.OPTB;I hope it's something stately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00273.D;Within, cradled by silk, is a scroll containing a classic of chinese poetry. A rare gift indeed! But beneath it are the plans for a Chinese water-clock. Your artisans can have it built in a matter of days!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00273.OPTA;The Emperor is most welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00274.D;Within, cradled by silk, is a copy of the legendary Art of War by Sun Tzu, painstakingly copied and illustrated by an obviously skilled hand. Below it is a carved jade dragon, a sign of deep respect - and even some legitimacy! - from your Eastern counterpart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00274.OPTA;The Emperor is most welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00275.T;A Homecoming;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00275.D;With your predecessor having been gone for a while, you've since taken charge under their assumed death. Unfortunately, news arrives today that confirms it. A Chinese emissary explains that while investigating a disturbance in their countryside, they came across an uncovered tomb of one of their ancient emperors - and your predecessors body. They've taken the time to return the body to, recovered during their excavations, along with all they were wearing and a small scroll with some plans for a 'Tyrian Guard', inspired by what they saw there. While these things are a small comfort, the funeral at least provides a sense of finality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DAQIN.00275.OPTA;Requiescat in Pace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
